# Capstone_Project : Arvato Customer Segmentation and Prediction

This exercise is the final project of the Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree Program.

The purpose of this project is to compare demographics data information for the general population of an specified city with the demographics data of customers of mail-orders.
We need to use unsupervised learning techniques to perform customer segmentation (extracting the best features of the population that describ the best customers base), and 
supervised learning techniques to predict which individuals could be the most likely to become customers for the financial company.

## Submission Instructions

### What to Submit

### Required

At a minimum, your submission will be required to have the following files listed below. If your submission method of choice is uploading an archive (*.zip), please take into consideration the total file size. You will need to include

* Your capstone proposal document as proposal.pdf if you have completed the pre-requisite Capstone Proposal project. Please also include your review link in the student submission notes.
* A project report (in PDF format only) addressing the five major project development stages. The recommended page length for a project report is approximately nine to fifteen pages. Please do not export an iPython Notebook as PDF for your project report.
* All development Python code used for your project that is required to reproduce your implemented solution and result. Your code should be in a neat and well-documented format. Using iPython Notebooks is strongly encouraged for development.
* A README documentation file which briefly describes the software and libraries used in your project, including any necessary references to supporting material. If your project requires setup/startup, ensure that your README includes the necessary instructions.
* Any additional supporting material such as datasets, images, or input files that are necessary for your project's development and implementation. If these files are too large and you are uploading your submission, instead provide appropriate means of acquiring the necessary files in your included README.
